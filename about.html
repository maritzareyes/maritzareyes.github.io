				<p class="about-me"> I received my bachelor's degree in Geography/Environmental Studies and GIS from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). It wasn't until my last two
				years in college I fell in love with Geography and GIS, and decided to pursue a career in it. During my time as an undergraduate, I worked under the head GIS/Geography Librarian
				at UCLA's main research library, Charles E. Young. I first helped in cataloging historical maps, and providing faculty and students with geographic/GIS data (image above is a
				historical map of Mexico City from 1749). However, I was later part of bigger GIS projects for the library. Some of these projects included publishing an interactive map about our
				map collections!

				<br></br>

				After obtaining my degree, I began working as a GIS intern for the Fullterton Arboretum where I assisted in mapping out all the vegetation.
				At the same time I was also working part-time at an oil consulting software development company called Earth Science Associates. We  primarily focus on
				obtaining data for the Gulf of Mexico. My main duties have been maintaining and updating our automated pocesses for our GIS platform
				and desktop application. One current project we are working on is putting all our main data into a geodatabase.

				<br></br>

				Today, I continue to work full-time at Earth Science Associates, and am in the process of obtaining my Master's Degree in GIS & Web Map Programming from the
				University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am expected to graduate Fall 2019.
